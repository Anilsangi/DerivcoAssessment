Download Nunit and Selenium Packegs using Nuget manage Packger(Tools->Nuget manage Packger) 
Write the Scripts and Run the Scripts go through(Test->Run All tests)
All test is complted then you able to Results on Text Explorer (view->Text Explorer)

**Write two additional test cases that are not covered by the requirements below.**
1. Serach Cocktails like B__. There is no Cocktails like B__ but the results are coming
2. find the Single cocktail like ant cocktail name sould be  "Rail Splitter" i haven't write the script like that
3. Search as Single letter test case
